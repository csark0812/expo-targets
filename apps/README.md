## Running Examples

### Managed Workflow (most examples)

```bash
cd apps/<example>
npm install
npx expo prebuild --clean
npx expo run:ios
```

### Bare React Native Workflow

```bash
cd apps/<example>
npm install
npx expo-targets sync
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
npx react-native run-ios
```

### Building for Release

For React Native extensions, test in Release mode to catch memory issues:

```bash
npx expo run:ios --configuration Release
```

---

## Troubleshooting Examples

**Example doesn't build?**

```bash
# Clean and rebuild
rm -rf ios android node_modules
npm install
npx expo prebuild --clean
npx expo run:ios
```

**Widget doesn't appear?**

1. Build succeeded but widget not in picker?
2. Long press home screen → tap **+** → search for the app name
3. If not found: Product → Clean Build Folder (⇧⌘K) → rebuild

**Extension crashes?**

1. Check Xcode console for error messages
2. Verify App Group IDs match in app.json and expo-target.config.json
3. Try Release build: `npx expo run:ios --configuration Release`
