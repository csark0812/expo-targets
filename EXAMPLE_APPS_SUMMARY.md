## 💡 Key Learnings

### Architecture Patterns

1. **Single Target**

   ```
   targets/my-target/
     index.ts          # Config + helpers
     ios/
       Widget.swift    # Implementation
   ```

2. **Multiple Targets (Shared Data)**
   ```
   targets/
     shared.ts         # Shared functions
     widget/
       index.ts        # Re-exports shared
       ios/
     clip/
       index.ts        # Re-exports shared
       ios/
   ```

### Best Practices

- ✅ Type-safe data operations
- ✅ Shared App Group for all targets
- ✅ Refresh after data changes
- ✅ Error handling in Swift
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Empty states
- ✅ Success feedback

---

## 🚀 Production Ready

2. **Used as reference** for implementing similar features
3. **Copied and modified** for new projects
4. **Tested on device** to verify functionality

---

The examples progress from simple to complex:

1. **Beginner:** widget-basic
2. **Intermediate:** clip-advanced, imessage-stickers
3. **Advanced:** share-extension, widget-interactive
4. **Expert:** multi-target

Each example builds on concepts from previous ones.
