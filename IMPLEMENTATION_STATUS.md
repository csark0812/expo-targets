## Known Limitations

### Current

1. **iOS Only**: Android not yet implemented (architecture ready)
2. **CocoaPods**: Integration present but commented out (needs testing)
3. **React Native Extensions**: Implemented but needs action extension testing
4. **Action Extensions**: No example app yet (build plugin ready)
5. **No CI/CD**: No automated testing or publishing pipeline

### By Design

1. **Build-time Config**: Configuration parsed during prebuild (no runtime changes)
2. **Swift Required**: Widget views must be written in Swift/SwiftUI (no RN for widgets)
3. **Release Only**: React Native extensions only work in Release builds
4. **App Groups Required**: Data sharing requires proper App Group configuration

## Architecture Highlights

### Strengths

✅ **Clean Separation**: Clear boundaries between plugin, API, metro, and native code
✅ **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript throughout
✅ **Extensibility**: Easy to add new extension types
✅ **Platform-Agnostic**: Android architecture prepared
✅ **Developer Experience**: Single file configuration + runtime
✅ **Build-Time Validation**: Errors caught early during prebuild

### Key Decisions

1. **`defineTarget()` API**: Unified config + runtime in one call
2. **Babel AST Parsing**: Allows dynamic configuration while extracting at build time
3. **`xcode` Package**: Pragmatic choice for Xcode manipulation (works reliably)
4. **`index.ts` Pattern**: Single file per target for config + runtime + types
5. **App Groups**: Standard iOS mechanism for data sharing
6. **External File Linking**: Swift files remain in `targets/` directory (not copied to ios/)
7. **Build Setting Inheritance**: Extensions inherit key settings from main app

## Technical Debt

### Minimal

The codebase is clean with minimal technical debt:

1. **CocoaPods Integration**: Present but commented out (needs testing before enabling)
2. **Error Handling**: Could be more granular in some places
3. **Logging**: Could add debug mode for troubleshooting
4. **Validation**: Could add more pre-flight checks

### None of these block production use

---

## Community Feedback Needed

Once published, gather feedback on:

1. **API Design**: Is `defineTarget()` intuitive?
2. **Documentation**: Are guides clear and complete?
3. **Extension Types**: Which types are most needed?
4. **Pain Points**: What's difficult or confusing?
5. **Feature Requests**: What's missing?

---

## Conclusion

expo-targets has achieved its **primary goal**: enabling iOS extension development in Expo apps with a clean, type-safe API. The implementation is production-ready for widgets, App Clips, iMessage stickers, and share extensions.

**Ready for:**

- ✅ Production iOS extension development (widget, clip, imessage, share)
- ✅ npm package publishing
- ✅ Community adoption
- ✅ Real-world usage

**Needs work:**

- Action extension example app
- Android implementation
- Automated testing infrastructure
